# CrowdednessPrediction-DeepLearningDTU-2020
Crowdedness prediction in public transport under Covid-19 using Smartcard demand-data (Rejsekort-data). In order to avoid full busses and trains, Movia, the public transport authority of Eastern Denmark, has a need for predicting how many passengers will be in vehicles and use this to adjust capacities (add/move vehicles) and target information under the Covid-19 pandemic. With the use of Rejsekort data (tap-ins / tap-outs) you will predict the passenger demand of tomorrow, so social distancing can be kept in the public transport.
